# 0x05. Python - Exceptions
## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- all your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## 0.Tasks
## Safe list printing

- Write a function that prints x elements of a list.
- Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):
- my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
- All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
- x represents the number of elements to print
- x can be bigger than the length of my_list
- Returns the real number of elements printed
- You have to use try: / except:
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use len()
## 1. Safe printing of an integers list
##Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

- Prototype: def safe_print_integer(value):
- value can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
- The integer should be printed followed by a new line
- Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
- Otherwise, returns False
- You have to use try: / except:
- You have to use "{:d}".format() to print as integer
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use type()
## 2. Print and count integers
## Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.

- Prototype: def safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0):
- my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
- All integers have to be printed on the same line followed by a new line - other type of value in the list must be skipped (in silence).
- x represents the number of elements to access in my_list
- x can be bigger than the length of my_list - if it’s the case, an exception is expected to occur
- Returns the real number of integers printed
- You have to use try: / except:
- You have to use "{:d}".format() to print an integer
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use len()
## 3. Integers division with debug
## Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.

- Prototype: def safe_print_division(a, b):
- You can assume that a and b are integers
- The result of the division should print on the finally: section preceded by Inside result:
- Returns the value of the division, otherwise: None
- You have to use try: / except: / finally:
- You have to use "{}".format() to print the result
- You are not allowed to import any module

## 4. Divide a list
## Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.

- Prototype: def list_division(my_list_1, my_list_2, list_length):
- my_list_1 and my_list_2 can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
- list_length can be bigger than the length of both lists
- Returns a new list (length = list_length) with all divisions
- If 2 elements can’t be divided, the division result should be equal to 0
- If an element is not an integer or float:
- print: wrong type
- If the division can’t be done (/0):
- print: division by 0
- If my_list_1 or my_list_2 is too short
- print: out of range
- You have to use try: / except: / finally:
- You are not allowed to import any module
## 5. Raise exception
## Write a function that raises a type exception.

- Prototype: def raise_exception():
- You are not allowed to import any module5. Raise exception
## 6. Raise a message
## Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.

- Prototype: def raise_exception_msg(message=""):
- You are not allowed to import any module
